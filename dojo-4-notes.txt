FaaS Internal Dojo

Topic: Activation


2 parts of activation:

1. Initialize:
Action code is sent to container and stored there.

2. Run:
Action params are sent to the container and action is run.

Initialization only happen if there is no available container.

If logCollectionLimit is not 0, logs will be collected.

On AWS deployment of FaaS, logs collection is disabled to enable concurrency.

After invocation is done, result will be stored in database.

Result of an invocation is a future object (like promise in javascript) and can be retrieved using invocationId.
